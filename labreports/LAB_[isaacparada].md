| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 |  Getting to the application invovled some bouncing around, but once I was on the site it was pretty straightforward. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  1 |  They had me upload personal information and resume twice. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  1 |  They told me what page of the process I was on, but that's it. I was wondering what might be next, if there was anything that might come up after the five steps, and how long it would take. Definitely could have given more information on the process.|
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |  Yes pre-apply site asked what position you were interested in. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  | I was asked to submit some information twice throughout the process. Could have been better coordinated. Overall not too much wording, so nothing glaringly stands out for this.|
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2 |  Navigation was easy and clear |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | Things were clearly laid out and information boxes easy to access.  |
